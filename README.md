## About

As many up and coming developers I realized that I struggled when it comes to mobile first design. I decided to get better and started looking for a good course, that is when I came across **The Net Ninja** YouTube channel. He has so many helpful course series on YouTube, and I took his **Mobile-First Responsive Build (with CSS Grid)** course series.

I started following this series and decided that I wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to also practice [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/). I wrote all the styling in SCSS, utilizing mixins as well as variables. I love using SCSS because of the nested syntax and also because I can have a couple of rules saved as a variable and apply it anywhere.

Below I have the steps required to clone my repo and have a basic SCSS set up in your local machine.

## Usage

_Make sure to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) so that you can use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) CLI, which comes with Node.js installation._

**Clone my repo**

`git clone https://github.com/SaboyaDev/Mobile-First-Responsive-Cosmo-Junkie.git`

**Install SASS globally** \*_(for more info [SASS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass))_

`npm install -g sass`

**Run SASS watch:**

- This will create a CSS file to the specified directory as well as constantly seeing for any changes in your SCSS file and update the CSS file. \*_(please make sure you already have the SCSS directory and file and CSS directory only)_

`sass --watch yourSCSSDirectory/style.scss yourCSSDirectory/style.css`

You can use tools such as [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) marketplace to work on a local server and see your code changes live on a browser.
